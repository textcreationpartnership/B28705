            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> for Passing the <hi>Turky Companies</hi> Bill, to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the great Importations of <hi>Thrown Silk.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat this Company Exporting Annually to the value of Three or Four hundred Thousand pounds in <hi>Cloth, Tinn, Lead</hi> and the Manufactures of this Kingdom, cannot make Returns, but Three quarters at least must be in <hi>Raw Silk;</hi> which being Thrown in <hi>England,</hi> gives a quarter part of its value to the Poor, who are generally the Wives and Children of Seamen employed abroad; and that by this Throwing (upon a modest computation) there are not less than an <hi>Hundred Thousand</hi> Poor, that use to get their Livelihoods; every pound, according to its quality giving <hi>Two Shillings Six Pence,</hi> if coarse; and <hi>Three Shillings and Six Pence,</hi> if fine, to the Throwster.</p>
            <p>That they have not complained, until now that the Importations of Thrown Silk are augmented to double the former quantities, and brought fitted for all uses, insomuch that the Throwsters (as is found upon examination) have not half their usual imployment; and the <hi>Raw Silk</hi> of <hi>Turkey</hi> lyes by disesteemed. And if this be not consumed, we cannot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Woollen Manufactures.</p>
            <p>We are very unwilling to Impose any charge upon our Neighbours, and only desire so gentle an Imposition as may incourage our own poor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to private interest; for otherwise, it is well known that no Nation can Throw Silk cheaper and better then in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and if we be necesitated to bring it in Thrown from thence, we humbly submit to consideration, how great a loss it must be to this Nation, and consequently be the utter ruine of the Mystery of Throwing.</p>
            <p>And whereas we are told that only <hi>Italian Silk</hi> can answer for some uses, We could be glad such an expedient night be sound, as to exempt that sort, but since all Laws regard the Major, we hope that inconveniency cannot be great, considering the very small Consumption in that respect, That sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only from <hi>Bologna,</hi> which consumes little of our Manufactures, and is only bought with ready Money; and if 20 <hi>d.</hi> upon a <hi>pound</hi> be added upon <hi>Thrown Silk</hi> from <hi>Italy</hi> (which will make 20 <hi>yards</hi> of <hi>Wrought Silks</hi>) it will not be 2 <hi>per C.</hi> charge to the <hi>Weaver</hi> in his Fabrick, whereas it is above 25 <hi>per C.</hi> (if brought in <hi>Thrown</hi>) loss to the Thowster and the Nation: and if one sort of <hi>Thrown Silk</hi> be permitted free, all sorts of Thrown will enter under that denomination.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Act of Navigation</hi> hath prevented the <hi>Dutch</hi> from bringing in <hi>Raw Silk,</hi> as not being of the growth of their Countrey, but by Throwing it in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they Import it as their own Manufacture, and so gain from 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> to 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per l.</hi> to their own poor; which would be much more for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this Nation, that it were brought in <hi>Raw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we humbly desire to be restrained our selves from bringing <hi>Thrown Silk</hi> from <hi>Turkey,</hi> and that all Silk of the growth of <hi>Turkey, India,</hi> or any part of <hi>Asia,</hi> brought in hither Thrownd from any place whatsoever, may be charged with 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we hope we cannot be Judged partial to our own Trade, but propose the Nations Interest, since we desire but 20 <hi>d. per l.</hi> upon <hi>Italian Silk</hi> and yet are willing to have <hi>Thrown Silk</hi> from <hi>Turkey,</hi> charged with 4 <hi>s. per l.</hi> for the Encouragement and Advantage of the poor of this Nation.</p>
